> Build a simple static blog website (no login, no user accounts, no backend).
>
> Homepage design:
>
> * Layout should look like Pinterest (masonry grid).
> * Each blog post is shown as an image card.
> * The size of each image card should automatically adjust based on the blog content length (short content = smaller card, long content = bigger card).
> * Blog title must be displayed inside the image (overlay text).
> * Cards must be responsive for mobile and desktop.
>
> Interaction:
>
> * When a user clicks an image card, open a separate blog post page.
> * Blog post page should show full title, description, and full content.
> * Include a “Back to home” button to return to the Pinterest-style homepage.
>
> Data:
>
> * Preload exactly 3 example blog posts with random sample data:
>
>   * Each blog must have: title, short description, image, and long content text.
>   * Content should be realistic blog-style paragraphs (not lorem ipsum).
>
> Technical requirements:
>
> * Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).
> * No authentication, no database, no server.
> * All data stored in a JavaScript array.
> * Use CSS grid or masonry-style layout for Pinterest effect.
> * Smooth hover effect on cards.
>
> Output:
>
> * Generate all required files (index.html, style.css, script.js).
> * Code must be clean and commented.
> * Must run by simply opening index.html in browser.
